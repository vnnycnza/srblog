Ages ago, people would look at the temple and say, *“God is there. That’s where His glory dwells.”*

Today, God wants people to look at you and say, **“God is there. That’s where His glory dwells.”** Not because we are perfect, but because **people see the difference God is making in our lives**.

## Positional Holiness
> "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight." **~ Ephesians 1:4**

> "Because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" **~ 1 Peter 1:16**

- Our positional holiness is a status that we never deserve, but which God gives to us.
- We are made holy through Jesus Christ, just as we are made righteous in Him.

> "All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you." **~ John 14:25-26**

## Progressive Holiness

> "Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose." **~ Philippians 2:12-13**

### God's view on Holiness
- We are made holy through Christ but we are to remain holy as a choice.
- In Haggai 2:11-14, we see how God illustrates holiness by means of comparing consecrated meat and defiled body.
- Hypocrisy dishonors the Lord.
- God helps us to achieve holiness. **He works in us.**

#### We should strive to *live out* and *work out* our salvation.

## Living as God's Holy Temple

> "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things." **~ Philippians 4:8**

> "For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks" **~ Matthew 12:34**

- Be cautious of what consumes our hearts and minds.
- When we honor God, we live as His holy temple.
- Our lives should mirror God's work in us.
- He shall be glorified by our lives -- how we live it and how others see Christ in us.

> "Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us." **~ 1 Peter 2:12**
