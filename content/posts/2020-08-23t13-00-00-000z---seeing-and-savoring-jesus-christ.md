## Seeing Jesus Christ
- Not with the eyes of your head, but the eyes of your heart

> *"having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints"* **~ Ephesians 1:28 ESV**

- When we see with our spiritual eyes, we see the **truth** and **beauty** and **value** of Jesus Christ for what they really are.

## Savoring Jesus Christ
- When you see something as true and beautiful and valuable, you savor it.

- If we don’t savor Christ, we haven’t seen Christ for who he is. If we don’t prize him above all things, we haven’t apprehended his true worth.

## The Ultimate Aim of Jesus Christ
- We were made to know and treasure the glory of God above all things, and when we trade that treasure for images, everything is **disordered**.

- The gospel of the modern world is finding significance in man’s own self-image.

### Glory of Christ
- The Christian gospel is about the **“glory of Christ”** and not about me - the glory of Christ = the glory of God.

#### Exact Representation
> *"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven."* **~ Hebrews 1:3 ESV**

#### Image of God
> *"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."* **~ Colossians 1:15 ESV**

#### Glory of God in the face of Christ
> *"For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."* **~ 2 Corinthians 4:6 ESV**

## The Deity of Jesus Christ

- Christ does not exist in order to make much of us. We exist in order to enjoy making much of him.

- To know the glories of Christ is **an end, not a means**. 

- Christ is not glorious so that we get wealthy or healthy. Christ is glorious so that rich or poor, sick or sound, we might be satisfied in him.

- God is the absolute Reality, there is no before or after. 

> *8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”* **~ Revelation 1:8 ESV**

- His name ‘I AM’ implies absolute, eternal Reality

> *"6 Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last;  besides me there is no god."* **~ Isaiah 44:6 ESV**

- Jesus is the Alpha and Omega
> *"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."* **~ Revelation 22:13 ESV**

- Jesus is I AM
> *"Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”"* **~ John 5:58 ESV**

### Seeing and savoring this glory is the goal of our salvation

> *"Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world."* **~ John 17:24 ESV**

## The Gladness of Jesus Christ

### Christ is our reward
- Jesus himself, and all that God is for us in him, is our great reward, nothing less.

> *"Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst”"* **~ John 6:35 ESV**

- Salvation is not merely forgiveness of sins, but the fellowship in Jesus.

> *"God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."* **~ 1 Corinthians 1:9 NIV**

- The eternal Christ, God’s happy and equal agent in creation, was ever rejoicing before God. He mirrors perfectly the infinite, holy, indomitable mirth of his Father.

> *"You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."* **~ Hebrews 1:9 NIV**

### There is joy in suffering

- This joy is indestructible and all-sustaining, but it does not mean that there is only joy.

- Jesus was **“a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.”** (Isaiah 53:3)

- He wept *(John 11:35)*, and rejoiced *(Luke 10:17,21)*. He was hungry *(Matthew 4:2)*, he was weary *(John 4:6)*, he was forsaken *(Matthew 26:56)*, betrayed *(Matthew 26:45)*, whipped *(Matthew 27:26)*, mocked *(Matthew 27:31)*, and crucified *(Matthew 27:35)*

- And yet, through the agonies of Gethsemane and Golgotha, Jesus was sustained by indestructible joy.

> *"looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."* **~ Hebrews 12:2 ESV**

### We are not only to imitate the Lord’s suffering, but the Lord’s joy in it.

> *"And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit"* **~ 1 Thessalonians 1:6 ESV**

## Reflection

- Are we going to answer God’s call to "...go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured."?

- The answer is going to hang on to whether the City of God is more desirable to us than the City of Man.

> *"13 Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured. 14 For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come."* **~ Hebrews 13:13-14 ESV**
