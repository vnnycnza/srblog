## More than Memorizing
- The devil can memorize Scripture

> *Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:*

> > *“‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’[a]”* **~ Matthew 4:5-6**

- Memorization does not equal to God’s Word abiding in us

> *"and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life."* **~ John 5:38-39**

## So why memorize?

### I. Conformity to Christ
Bible memorization has the effect of making our gaze on Jesus steadier and clearer.

> *"And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."* **~ 2 Corinthians 3:18**

> *"And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord."* **~ 1 Samuel 3:21**

### II. Constant Meditation on God’s Word
When we have the Scriptures hidden in our hearts, if we are regularly reviewing and learning them, we make the truth of Scripture available to our minds all throughout the day.

> *"but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night."* **~ Psalms 1:2**

### III. Equipped for Everyday Life

#### Daily Triumph Over Sin
- Memorizing Scripture makes God’s Word more accessible for overcoming temptation to sin.

- The worth and beauty of the Christ-revealing word of Scripture is far superior to what sin offers.

> *"I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you."* **~ Psalm 119:11**

> *"For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."* **~
Romans 8:13**

> *"and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,"* **~ Ephesians 6:17**

#### Daily Triumph Over Satan
- The god of this world is a liar, and memorizing Scripture guards out mind and helps us detect errors.

> *Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written,*

> > *“‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”* **~ Matthew 4:8-10**

#### Comfort and Counsel People you Love
- The very Word of God spoken from the heart has unusual power

> *"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver."* **~ Proverbs 25:11**

#### Communicate the Gospel to Unbelievers
The verses of the Bible have their own penetrating power
- God’s holiness/law/glory
- Man’s sin/rebellion/disobedience
- Christ’s death for sinners
- The free gift of life by faith

### IV. Communion with God 

- Bringing God’s Word into connection with our minds to enjoy His person and His ways.

- Memorizing the Scripture makes this connection more constant, more deep, and more transforming.

> *"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."* **~ Romans 10:17**

> *"Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth."* **~ John 17:17**
