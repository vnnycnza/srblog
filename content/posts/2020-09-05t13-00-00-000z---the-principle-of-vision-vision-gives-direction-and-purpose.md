> ### Where there is no vision, the people perish. - Proverbs 29:18 KJV

## What is Vision

![vision](https://media.giphy.com/media/Yavo0SXhZYhSo/giphy.gif)
- It is a clear mental picture of what a person wants to be and to accomplish. Establishing a vision begins by finding the answer to this question: “Why am I on earth?”
- Our vision begins to come clear as we find God’s person purpose and plan for our lives here on earth.

## The importance of Vision
### Vision motivates

We cannot overemphasize the importance of having a vision. We need vision to motivate us to reach God-given potential and purpose, and to maximize our lives for Him.

### Vision serves as a compass

Vision gives direction and purpose to our children. Direction is important because it determines the ultimate destination of our lives. Thus, it acts as a guide in our decision-making and prioritizing our activities to achieve our vision. Proverbs 29:18 rightly states that without vision, people perish.

### Vision gives significance

> *"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."*  **~ Jeremiah 29:11**

This verse encourages us that God knows the good plans He has for us. He has a vision for us with a future full of hope. Knowing this will assure us that *we are not just mere statistics* in the world’s population, but we are significant. We have a God-given plan for their lives and a vision to fulfill.

## Developing a vision for our life
### Know that God has a unique vision for each of us

> *“We are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”* **~ Ephesians 2:10 ESV**

According to this verse, each of us, in Christ Jesus, is God’s workmanship, His masterpiece. Each of us is **one of a kind**! He has a vision for each of us that He has uniquely designed in advance for us to accomplish. God created each one for a special purpose.

### Vision must impact our present choices

Our choices have consequences. They will impact our future. Our choices have consequences. We are free to choose, but we cannot escape the consequences of our choices. God holds us responsible for our choices.

> *"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."* **~ Galatians 6:7 ESV**

### The Importance of Delayed Gratification

In the Bible and as Christian, we are called to exercise delayed gratification; that is to *“wait on God.”* Instant gratification is going our own direction. Waiting on God is one of the things that He most longs for as we pursue after His heart. For this reason, it is important to know how to become a master of delayed gratification. No Christian will ever be successful in his or her Christian walk
without knowing how to say “no” to the pleasures of sin today in order to receive the crown of life when Jesus Christ returns.

> *"Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord."* **~ Psalm 27:14**

## Cast God’s General Vision for our Lives

> ### *Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God. ~ 1 Corinthians 10:31*

This is God’s big-picture vision for all who follow Him. The primary vision for our children should be to glorify God in all we do. We are on this earth to make a **positive difference** in this world for God’s glory.
