Tonight, we dwell more about the amazing power of God's Word. We have two main points to highlight. The first one is **Worldview vs Wordview** inspired by Victory's Series on Wordview way back in 2018. You can listen to the podcast [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/7l5x0ReSeJgtkDg5qSAaRP?si=EnZTeZ-2Q_mebl7nwyrA-A). The second is **Benefits of the Word**.

## I. Worldview vs. Wordview
Living life according to what the **Word** says rather than the perspective of the world.
> "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will." **~ Romans 12:2**

#### Background of Romans:
- Paul has never been to Rome when he wrote this.
- That's why the letter stands as the clearest and most systematic presentation of Christian doctrine in all Scriptures.
- Rome is a prominent city back then and is a hotbed of sexual immorality and idol worship.
- **He established the idea that the world is evil.** And proceeded to the fact that God justified us by faith through Christ Jesus. **And we were made righteous because of Him.**
- That's why Paul can outrightly say to not confrom to this world.

#### Why should we renew our minds?
- Because it is the first step for our transformation.
- It all begins with our thoughts. It's a matter of perspective.
- We must always reflect about the following:
    * What/who influences us the most?
    * What usually occupies most of our time to?
    * Who are we usually with or who do we usually talk to?

#### God's logic vs. Human logic
- We always go for the things that make sense to us.
- Pastor Peter Tan Chi's daughter's story is a very compelling story where we can draw inspiration on how something so terrible (that may seem not to make any sense at all why it happened) can be turned into a very powerful testimony.
- Stephen as the first martyr. (Acts 7:54-60)
- Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4)
- Believers selling their possessions (Acts 2:42-47)
- Elijah (1 King 19:4) - **"I have had enough, Lord"**
- Job (Job 13:23-24) - **"Make known to me my sin, why do You hide Your face and consider me Your enemy?"**
- Jonah (Jonah 4:9)

These examples are grandiose. But even in the little things, I want us to be reminded to choose **God's ways over ours**. In all these examples, God's good, pleasing, and perfect will was done. Because people knew the importance of God's Word.

#### What happens when we don't take importance of God's Word?
> " This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night,.." **~ Joshua 1:8**

- Convenient Christianity is when we are only Christians when it is convenient to us, and to some extent, we just accept the things that don't make sense if it benefits us. Like how God is a loving and forgiving God. But when God said to meditate on His words day and night, it is so easy for us to brush it off. 
- When something **costs us our comfort**, we tend to neglect God's word.

#### Reflect on these:
- When we acknowledge hypocrisy, do we do something about it?
- Do we meditate on God's Word with gladness?
- What is our motivation in knowing God more?
- How does God's word affect our everyday decisions?

#### "In order to hear God's voice, you must turn down the world's volume."

## II. Benefits of The Word
> "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness" **~ 2 Timothy 3:16**

#### Teaching/Doctrine
- We will be able to know the truth.
- The Bible tells us what is true about God, man, the world we live in, and the world to come.
- Evident in Paul's way of teaching the Gentiles when he constantly used OT Scriptures to explain them the gospel.

#### Reproof and Correction
> "...and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also." **~ 2 Timothy 2:2**

- Something to reflect on: Why is teaching others, rebuking others (that may even cause misunderstandings) a benefit?
- This is where the Bible's power to change lives starts. Realization and conviction.

#### "The greatest benefit in reading God's word is to avoid sin, thus glorifying God."

#### Instructions in Righteousness
> "..and for training in righteousness." **~ 2 Timothy 3:16**

- This basically tells us how we should live our lives-- **in true righteousness.** 
- This also implies that the Word of God has authority over us. It should be the **FINAL** authority in our lives. As shared earlier, how do we value God's Word? Do we only follow it when convenient?
- As shared again and again, we are **MADE RIGHTEOUS** through Christ.

#### Complete/Perfect

> "that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." **~ 2 Timothy 3:17**
- This means that the Bible leads us into everything we need.
- #### "Perfect means to be who God wants us to be." (Ptr. Peter) 
- The Word of God is our weapon in doing good works.
- Because our good works glorifies God, our good works will point people to Jesus.
- Everything is for the glory of God.

#### Reflection
- Where are you now in your faith journey? How is it?
- How do we speak? How do we make decisions?
- Are we committed to our devotions? Are we taking it seriously?

> "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." **~ James 1:22**

We should remember that we cannot do this on our own. To conclude, let us constantly check our hearts and be reminded of *Philippians 2:13*. Do not be disheartened, our God works in us. 

#### "for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

Have fun indulging in God's word from our silly faces! 🙏😃
