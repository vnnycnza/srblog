Tonight we talk about the story of Jesus walking on water as found in **Matthew 14:22-33**.

> "Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake." **~ Matthew 14:25**

## 1) Seeking God’s Kingdom
> “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” **~ Matthew 13:28**

In this verse, we see Peter’s desire to walk with the Jesus, even at the risk of an **“IF”**. Out of all possible tests to prove Jesus’ identity, Peter asked Jesus to prove who He is. 

> "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." **~ Matthew 7:7a**

We, as people of God, our main goal is be with God and to glorify Him. Let us follow Peter’s desire to seek and to be with Jesus.

> But from there you will seek the Lord your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. **~ Deuteronomy 4:29**

> Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart **~ Psalm 119:2**

Perhaps Jesus saw **Peter’s desire to be with Him** thus granting Peter’s request to walk on water with HIM.

## 2) Keeping our focus on Jesus
### Peter's lost focus
Peter lost focus on Jesus and focused more on the big waves and strong winds then started to drown (v30). In life, it is unavoidable to experience big waves and strong winds that blocks our view of Jesus. Such waves and winds are so strong that it overpower us that may lead us to be overwhelmed and possibly lead us to the sense of defeat. But v31, it said **“Immediately, Jesus reached out His hand and caught Him”**. Similarly in the story, when we are overpowered and overwhelm; the Bible has this for those people

> "The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged." **~ Deuteronomy 31:8**

#### "If God is for us, who can be against us?"" *~ Romans 8:31*

#### "'For I know the plans I have for you', declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.'" *~ Jeremiah 29:11*

With these 2 promises, we can be assured that no matter how strong the winds or how big the waves may be, as long as we are in the presence of the Lord, we will remain standing above it all.

### Peter's little faith
Peter's little faith is a reminder that we should be steadfast with our faith, otherwise, we may be like Peter who almost drowned. Be steadfast in our faith and believe in our God. God’s promises there is nothing for us to fear in this world.

> "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." **~ Matthew 6:33**

## 4) Worshipping together
### Those in the boat worshipped Him (v.33)
All of them had witnessed and worshipped Jesus together. In modern times, we get to witness different godly approaches that can teach us and deepen our relationship with God.

> "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God." **~ Colossians 3:16**

> "What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up." **~ 1 Corinthians 14:26**

Although we walk in different paths, we, as people God, share a common enemy that will try to steal, kill and destroy like thief at the night.

> "Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." **~ Galatians 6:2**

Each of us walking different ways in life, we can be a lesson or a comforter for each other. Let us then continue to worship our God together and nurture one another in the name of the Lord.
