God’s plan is inevitable. As Christians, we try to always make sense of the situations that we are put in but at the end of the day we can only trust in God’s grace and wisdom for us to fulfill His purpose.

We can see this in the events that transpired in Esther’s life, how God has a purpose for everything that happens, that we are given opportunities to fulfill His will, and that given these opportunities we must be courageous and put our faith in God.

## I. God has a purpose for everything
- Esther’s beauty was not an accident. God purposely created Esther to be a *“young woman who had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at”* for her to become a queen *at the right time*.

> "Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died." **~ Esther 2:7**

> "For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" **~ Esther 4:14**

- He put Esther in a position where she can be *effective*.

> "Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti." **~ Esther 2:17**

## II. We are given opportunities to play a role in His plan

- God gives us divine moments to alter circumstances

- God’s purpose and plan will always be carried out regardless of who takes part in it, what the circumstances are, and how it will be carried out.

- We must continually pray and communicate with God in order for us to be aligned with His will. 

- Prayer and fasting is one way for us to do so. Prayer and fasting opens the portals for spiritual growth, removes distractions and places us on a path to humility.

## III. We must always stand with courage

- God demands obedience and total obedience to God requires a lot of courage to be able to push through whatever hardships you face.

- God’s desire was to save His people and He used Esther to do this, but not without risks. We see in Esther 4:16 how Esther’s courage was used by God to fulfill His purpose to save His people.

> “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.” **~ Esther 4:16**

### *"And if I perish, I perish."*

- Our confidence should never be grounded on people or circumstances, it should be grounded on the One who never changes and who allows us to be victorious, and that is God. 

- When we are confident in our God, we can be courageous in whatever situation we are in because we know that whatever happens, He never fails.

## Reflection
- What are your divine moments? How did God act on these moments?
- Where does your confidence lie? Is it on God or on people?
