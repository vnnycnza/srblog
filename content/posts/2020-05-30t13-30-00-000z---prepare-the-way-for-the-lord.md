> "Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, *'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'* For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said,
*"THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS,
'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD,
MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!'"*" **~ Matthew 3:1-3**

> "and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins." **~ Matthew 3:6**

## How did John prepare the way?

John fulfilled the prophecy in Isaiah 40:3, when he preaches in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
> *“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”*

Notice that the people from Jerusalem, Judea, and all the district around Jordan cooperated in preparing the way for Jesus.

### How did the people cooperate?
They confessed their sins and were baptized as a sign that they have turned from their sins, as Matthew 3:6 tells us, 
> *“And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.”*


## What does it mean to prepare the way for the Lord?

It means to create a **favorable environment** or to make it easy for one to come to you and **operate** in your life. Let’s take a look at Luke 3:4-5:

> *The voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Make ready the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight." "Every ravine will be filled, And every mountain and hill will be brought low; The crooked will become straight, And the rough roads smooth;"*

Apparently, John the Baptist was creating a favorable environment and making it easy for Jesus to enter into and operate in the lives of the people. These truths are still true even today.

### First, we must confess our sins, not just simply acknowledge them like what the Pharisees and Sadducees did.

> *But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?* **~ Matthew 3:7**

### Second, we must bear fruit in keeping with repentance.

> *Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.* **~ Matthew 3:8**

### Finally, when we’ve accepted Jesus as our Savior, He has justified us and sanctify us. 

> #### *Justification is God's totally complete work to purchase our forgiveness. Sanctification is God's ongoing work to change and grow us.*

## How does this apply to us today?

It is a beautiful revelation that we can *‘prepare the way’* for the Lord in our own lives. John the Baptist was said to be sent forth to prepare the way for Jesus, but what exactly did he do? He preached the repentance of sins and baptized people for the remissions of their sins. He was getting people ready for Jesus’ arrival by getting them to turn from their sins and repent! For as Hebrews 12:14 tells us, “…holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”

> *"Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."* **~ Hebrews 12:14**

Let God’s sanctification in us be made complete! God didn’t promise us an easy and comfortable life, but He has promised that He will continue the work He began in us.

We may be satisfied with who we are, but God isn’t and He will not quit until His work is done.

## Conclusion

- By confessing and turning from our sins, we can prepare the way for the Lord to move and operate in our lives as well. 
- But we must always depend on God’ powerful, transforming grace to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves – to be holy and that was sanctification is really all about; letting God do for us what we cannot do for ourselves.
- Let Him operate in our lives as He rules the very motivational system of our heart.
