> ### *"but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,"* **~ 1 Peter 3:15**


It is used to be that if you were a Christian, you were thought of as a bit strange, perhaps naïve. Now Christians are often targeted as the enemies of societal progress.  More than ever, we need to be prepared to defend a Christian way of seeing the world. 

Peter encourages us to be ready to ask and answer hard questions. The health of the church in the days ahead, in large part, will be determined by the way we handle questions. The opportunity to remove an obstacle to faith in a person’s life is even more important than getting your dream job, so you need to take the time to be prepared.

Jesus was a superb conversationalist. In all of the Gospels we see that Jesus spent a lot of time talking with people, and it is not unreasonable to think He had as great an impact through His conversational ministry. He should be our role model. Like Him, we need to spend more time conversing about meaningful topics, especially spiritual ones. We need to take conversation seriously as a spiritual discipline.

Here are some humanistic ideologies that are not of Biblical standard and which we have to stand strongly against when having conversations.

## Pluralism
![opinion](https://media.giphy.com/media/5XNEIKcohVG8w/giphy.gif)
- “All views are equally valid.”
- It claims that although our opinions about the deep questions of life may seem different on the surface, they are actually the same or at least of equal merit. 

### Truth

> *Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.”* **~ John 14:6 ESV**

## Relativism
![relative](https://media.giphy.com/media/XGUmeY8IRsCpwstriz/giphy.gif)
- “Truth is relative.”
- While relativity takes a variety of forms, the basic idea is the truth is not the same for all of us. We are told that all truth is relative to the individual, and therefore maybe Jesus is true for you but not for me. It claims that we can create our own truth, morality, and meaning on an individual level.

### Truth
But there’s a clear problem with saying, “All truth is relative.” Does that include the truth that all truth is relative? Is that also relative? If so, then what reason do I have to believe you when you tell me that all truth is relative? Maybe even that truth is true for you and not for me. 

But our truth is Jesus is our Savior.
> *Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.* **~ Philippians 5:11**

## Humanism
![humans](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZaR2nkOBo7WRS6Wt7G/giphy.gif)
- “self-reliance as an ultimate virtue.”
- Humanism, at least in its aesthetic form, claims that humanity can create its own value, meaning, and purpose on a societal level. 
- It is up for humanity to save itself. 

### Truth
The Bible depicts self-reliance as the original sin. The first humans could resist the temptation to **“be like God”** (Gen. 3:5). In sharp contrast to ultimately relying on ourselves, Christianity teaches that the only way for us to truly live is to remove ourselves from the equation. Self-reliance or God-reliance is the simple life-defining choice that every heart has to make.

> *“Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.”* **~ Jeremiah 17:5 ESV**

> *"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."* **~ Romans 3:23 ESV**

## Hedonism
![happy](https://media.giphy.com/media/6sUDopyILlBHW/giphy.gif)
- “Life is all about happiness or pleasure.” 
> “I didn’t go to religion to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of Port would do that. If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly don’t recommend Christianity.” -C.S. Lewis

### Truth
Are you happy? Great. Are you forgiven? But do you have purpose? Do you have meaning in life? We were born for so much more than just pleasures. 

> *“I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”* **~ John 16:33 NIV**


> *You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.* **~ Psalm 16:11 ESV**

> *“There’s nothing more unloving than refusing to share the truth with another person. If you have the truth that can greatly benefit someone, it is an act against love not to share it with them”* **–Vince Vitale**

## So why have these kinds of conversations?

### It is the Great Commission.
> *Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.* **~ Matthew 28:19 NIV**

> *But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.* **~ Acts 1:8 NIV**
