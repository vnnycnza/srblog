We've had all kinds of fellowship back then and we decided to have those fellowships because of our spiritual needs as CYF.

## Chill Night, Fortress, Retreats
![fellowship](fellowship.png)

In celebration of our 4th monthsary last week of virtual fellowship, I want us to be reminded and refreshed of the reasons why we do this. What we do is more than just meeting together as friends and to be updated with each other's lives. It is also more than just hearing the word of God corporately.

# Importance of Small Groups

## A Reflection of God's Nature.

>> *"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world."* **~ John 17:24**

>> *"The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands."* **~ John 3:35**

>> *"For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed."* **~ John 5:20**

>> *"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."* **~ Matt. 12:18**

- Context of the verses - *Jesus praying for the believers.*

- The very nature of the relationship of God to His Son and vice versa is love. So how can we say that what we do is a reflection of God's nature? 

- As told in John 13, Jesus showed the disciple the full extent of His love by washing of their feet.

### Love is best practiced in small groups. Just as Jesus did to His disciples.

## Meeting Together is a Command.

>> *"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."* **~ Hebrews 10:24-25**

- There is no such thing as a lone ranger Christian.You cannot practice these things if you don't have anyone whom you walk with.

- The phrase "one another" or "allelon" (ah-lay-loan) was mentioned in the New Testament exactly 100 times. This shows how much God values the way we treat each other.

- Hebrews was written around 60-70AD and there are already "some" who have forsaken meeting together.

- Knowing that Jesus is coming back soon should have an impact on our decisions and motivations.

## The Body of Christ in Action
![unity](https://media.giphy.com/media/rj12FejFUysTK/giphy.gif)

>> *"For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;"* **~ Romans 12:4-6**

- Meeting together is a manifestation of us, as one body, being in action moving towards a common goal. As one body, we should work together to **bring out the best in each other** and to be as effective as possible.

- Sa ayaw at sa gusto natin, parte tayo ng isa't isa. Our spiritual gifts are meant to be used to strengthen the body.

- This is also a practice done by the early Christians. These verses refer to the early churches meeting together at one house.

>> *"Greet also the church that meets at their house."* **~ Romans 16:5**

>> *"The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla[a] greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house."* **~ 1 Corinthians 16:19**

>> *" Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house."* **~ Colossians 4:15**

# Purpose of Small Groups

## Foster a Healthy Relationships

### With God
>> *"And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate[a] the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."* **~ 2 Corinthians 3:18**

- The ultimate goal is Christ-likeness. It is important for followers of Christ to take whatever steps necessary to ensure a constant and growing relationship with God. And one of the necessary steps is to be in fellowship with other believers.

>> *"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."* **~ Proverbs 27:17**


### With Other Believers
>> *"Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,"* **~ Acts 2:46**

- Meeting with fellow Christians is not just about studying the Bible together in a religious setting every once in a while. It is more of opening up one's life and sharing meals to build relationships that truly care and look out for each other's welfare day in and day out.

- Having healthy relationship with believers that are in our circle makes it easier to translate the love we have for each other to other believers outside our circle.

## Fulfill God's Call to Service and Ministry
![service](https://media.giphy.com/media/UT5KSLhKwItfq6Yv6q/giphy.gif)

>> *"So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up"* **~ Ephesians 4:11-12**

- Through fellowships, we are being equipped to be of service to the body of Christ, which is the church, which is our fellow Christians.

- Our model of servanthood is Christ. Stepping out of His heavenly home and giving Himself as a ransom for many.

>> ### "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." ~ Mark 10:45

>> ### "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others." - Mahatma Gandhi

## Fulfill God's Mission of Evangelism and Discipleship

>> *"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."* **~ John 13:34-35**

- Love is our most effective witness.

### What God is doing in our lives through this fellowship should not be confined within the walls of our group.

- This is where we differ from just a social club enjoying the presence of each other. **Our fellowship should point onlookers to a relationship with Christ.** Just like what happened to the early church in Acts 2:47.

## Conclusion

### Let us be reminded of the purpose and importance of having fellowship with co-believers like this.

>> *"Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."* **~ Galatians 6:2**

## Reflection
- How has this fellowship helped you in our goal to be Christlike?
