## Worshipping Together

> *"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."* **~ Matthew 18:20**

> *"Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near."* **~ Hebrews 10:25**

> *"What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up"* **~ 1 Corinthians 14:26**

> *"Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins."* **~ 1 Peter 4:8**

## Conclusion
- The God we serve is both **merciful** and **just**; He loves us but abhor our sins. 

- He reaches out, teaches and disciplines us whenever necessary. But we have a choice if we would choose to follow God and at the end of time, our God would take His people and place them unto His kingdom.

- As Christians, we can either see and walk towards His glory or back away from God’s wrath; we can either hold on to His promises or fear His anger.

- Whichever choice may be, get together with your brethren in Christ and grow, learn from each other and support one another. In that way, we have pleased the Lord by abiding in His command.
