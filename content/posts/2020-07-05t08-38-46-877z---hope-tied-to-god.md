Tonight, I want to share you with you 3 points that seem to be very relevant with the recent experiences and situations that we are in -- these are: Uncertainties, Disappointments & Hope.

## Uncertainties

Uncertainty is the *fear of the unknown*. In one of my recent devotions, the author pointed out how humans are very attached to outcomes.

> *"Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails"* **~ Proverbs 19:21**

Indeed, the Bible confirms that. We like planning a lot and even though  you may not be the planning type of person, the idea of the future has a bearing on our decisions. We like playing out how our lives should turn out. We plan about our dreams, our goals and our future.

> #### *"We praise God when normal looks like what we thought it would be. But, we question God when it doesn’t."*

### What does the Bible tell us about uncertainty?

> *“But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”* **~ 1 Corinthians 15:57**

Uncertainties will always be present in our lives, and so is the victory we are given through Jesus Christ. While we may have plans that didn't come across or tough decisions that we aren't certain of the outcome, the truth remains that we have the victory. But tonight, I want us to define victory not as how the world defines it; rather, as the Scriptures does. Usually victory is synonymous to success, celebration, or winning over something; but victory through Jesus Christ is beyond what the world's victory is. 

> *"...I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""* **~ Jeremiah 29:10-11**

The Lord has a GOOD promise, and the Lord has GOOD plans. Not just good plans, they must be better plans than our plans. While there are many uncertainties the world offers, let us build our trust in the truth that our God has a plan that will give us a hope and a future.

### Reflect

- What are you most uncertain of now?
- Can you recall a time that you felt very uncertain?
- Can you share a plan that you envisioned but did not become a reality?

## Disappointments

Tonight I'd like to define disappointments as *“n should be better than they are”* where n = things, people, circumstances, finances, relationships, etc.

When things don't go our way, we get disappointed. When we feel and think that there is something better, we get disappointed. This isn't unique and even in the Bible, there is a story I want us to study about in relation to disappointments.

### Story of Naomi

The story of Naomi is told in the book of Ruth. She faced a lot of disappointments when she went to Moab.

She was so disappointed and bitter of her life. She even wanted to identify as bitter when she asked people to call her Mara which means bitter.

> *"...it is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord’s hand has turned against me!"* **~ Ruth 1:3**

> *"“Don’t call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter."* **~ Ruth 1:20**

> *“I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.”* **~ Ruth 1:21**

### There are and will be disappointments

The Lord makes it clear in His Word that things will not always go as we wish they would.

> *"In this world you will have trouble."* **~ John 16:33**

> *"Each day has enough trouble of its own"* **~ Matthew 6:34**

> *"Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
"* **~ 1 Peter 4:12**

### Reflect

- What are your biggest disappointments?

## Hope

### Story of Naomi

Looking back to Naomi's story, while there are evident disappointments, the Lord has remained faithful with Naomi. And her story with Ruth didn't end in a disappointment.

#### Ruth 1:16-18
Naomi gained a loving and devoted daughter who clung to her tightly and never left her.

#### Ruth 1:22
She was able to return back to Bethlehem and they were blessed.

#### Ruth 4:16-17
Ruth and Boaz got married and had a son named Obed. Naomi cared for him as if he were her own. Obed became the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David. And as we know, Jesus is a descendant of David.

### There are and will be disappointments BUT...

Looking back again to the verses I shared earlier...

> *"In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."* **~ John 16:33**

> *"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own"* **~ Matthew 6:34**

> *"Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."* **~ 1 Peter 4:12**

The Scriptures tell us that just like uncertainties, disappointments are and will be present in our lives. BUT, the Lord has overcome the world. We do not need to worry, and we shall rejoice in the sufferings -- this is the true joy we have in Christ.

### Jeremiah 29:11: The Security Blanket

![blanket](https://media.giphy.com/media/W3QKEujo8vztC/giphy.gif)

We all know this verse. We might have memorized it by heart. But sometimes, we use it as a security blanket and we lose focus on the verses that follows.

> "Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." **~ Jeremiah 29:12-13**

While we trust in Lord for his great plans that will prosper and give us hope, do we call on Him? Do we come and pray to Him? Do we seek Him with all our heart?

### The point of tonight

#### "Let us tie our hope NOT on the “n”s, but to the very heart of God."

> *"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."* **~ Colossians 3:2**

> *Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”*
**~ Luke 18:27**

## Hope (for our country)

While we are on the topic of hope, I'd like to specifically tackle and pray about the hope for our country. 

![hope](https://media.giphy.com/media/3kJUV4yEzzZmCjmcgD/giphy.gif)

### Hoping doesn’t mean we ignore reality. Hoping means we acknowledge reality in the same breath that we acknowledge God’s sovereignty.

> *“Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”* **~ Jeremiah 29:7**

### Pray for our nation

The experience we feel right now could be likened to the Israelites when they were in exile. We wanted to be rescued, we cry out for justice, and we wanted to be in a better place. **Let us cling to the power of prayer and let us always pray for our country, for if it prospers, us too will prosper.** Let us not turn a blind eye to the reality BUT we should also acknowledge and trust God's sovereignty amidst everything.

Acknowledging God's sovereignty is too easy to say but is very difficult to do especially when all we see turns out to be frustrating and disappointing. The best way to acknowledge his sovereignty is to cling our hope to Him. The Lord is our source of strength and He listens to our cries. He has a perfect timing and He is in control.

### We can pray like Daniel

> *“Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.”* **~ Daniel 9:18-20**

Perhaps, we can pray like Daniel. We pray for our nation to have better and competent leaders, not because we are righteous and that we know better, but because our nation bears His name and because we trust in His great mercy. Our leaders shall be God's servants (Romans 13:4) meant for the nation's good. 

But the Lord hates evil and the Lord sees oppression, why is He allowing this? Is that His will? Perhaps, the Lord is teaching us and wants us to learn something. That is why we shouldn't turn a blind eye. That is why we should seek for His wisdom.

Let us pray and cry out our desires for justice and provision to our God who is good, merciful and compassionate. In the same way, we must extend goodness, mercy & compassion towards our countrymen.

### HOPE for our country TIED to our GOD

> *“Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.”* **~ Daniel 2:20-21**

- The Lord is WISE and POWERFUL. 
- He CHANGES times and seasons.
- He has a perfect timing for everything.
- He DEPOSES kings and RAISES up others.
- He GIVES wisdom.
