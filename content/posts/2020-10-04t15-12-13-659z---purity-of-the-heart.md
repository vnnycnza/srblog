We always remind ourselves to check our hearts, but what does it really mean when we say this? What is the heart?

## Matthew 5:8 NIV
> ### *"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."*

## The Heart
![heart](https://media.giphy.com/media/UQOtfc9uIXVv9IidCD/giphy.gif)

- The Greek word used here for heart is Kardia, which we get our word cardiac. This word can also be translated as *"core"*.

- Jesus frequently referred to the heart in His ministry. 

> *"You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."* **~ Matthew 12:34 ESV**

> *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also"* **~ Matthew 6:21 ESV**

- The heart is the center of our being. This gives us the idea of it being the center of our *emotions*, *thoughts*, and *spirit* or *essence*. How do you feel? What do you think of the most? What is your purpose?

### The Problem

-  Jesus says that those who are of pure heart are blessed. But, the heart is naturally wicked.

> *"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?"* **~ Jeremiah 17:9 NIV**

- Sin starts with our thoughts. And our emotions are deceitful. That's why we are always reminded to think right.

> *"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."* **~ Philippians 4:8 NIV**

- Remember that Paul wrote these things when *he was in prison*. Our perspective should not be based on our circumstance, but on the object of our faith, which is Jesus Christ.

### The Transformation

- Now we know that our hearts are wicked and we should think of excellence. And this requires transformation of the heart.

> *"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."* **~ Romans 10:8-9 NIV**

- We can only have a pure heart by the grace of God and His power to transform. We should not stop by just knowing that the heart is wicked.

## Purity
![purity](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZCMUXl3a9fuUZ9sjFj/giphy.gif)
- The Greek word *Katharos* carries the idea of *cleanliness*, being *genuine*, and free from things that would adulterate something. It is similar to the concept of *holiness*.

- That is the context of what Jesus is saying when he said *"Blessed are the pure in heart"*. 

### He is speaking about the heart of someone whose heart has been made new and whose purity comes not from themselves, but from the presence of Jesus in their lives.

> *"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. 28 In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."* **~ Matthew 23:27-28 NIV**

- This reminds us that God sees the heart. So, no matter how good and righteous we look in people's eyes, it's all worthless if there's no internal work or transformation in us.

### Positional and Progressive Purity
- As purity is similar to the concept of holiness, we can similarly categorize purity into positional and conditional. Just like positional and progressive sanctification, we also have positional and conditional purity.

- Positional purity has the same concept with positional sanctification. We are made pure through Jesus Christ, our Lord and saviour.

- Meanwhile, conditional purity refers to the *condition of our heart* that reflects our walk with God. It may not change our position before Christ, but it does affect our fellowship with God and the way we see things.

### Seeing God: The Promise
![see](https://media.giphy.com/media/fikcSiz20fgfT9M7XX/giphy.gif)

- This promise can be viewed into 2 ways.

### The Future
The promise that those who are saved will go to heaven and see Him face to face.

### The Present
The other way to view this is the present, seeing God while we're still here on earth. Not in the literal sense. 

### So why did Jesus use this word?
- Jesus is speaking to a Hebrew audience who served an unseen God. And any good Hebrew would have been familiar with Exodus 33:20 where God tells Moses, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live."

- Hebrews are a people of the ear. "Hear, oh Israel."

#### Jesus used this to emphasize that seeing God is more than merely speaking of physical sight, it conveys the idea of perception, discernment and understanding.

- The way we see things changes perspective. The things we cannot fathom on our own are being revealed to us. And our understanding of who He is deepens.

### Blindness

- Blindness is often used as a metaphor to describe those who are lost. And this literally happened to Paul in the road to Damascus. Only then he understood who Jesus is.

> *"The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."* **~ 2 Corinthians 4:4 NIV**

> *"But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them."* **~ 1 John 2:11 NIV**

### Jesus is the Light of the World

> *"We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life."* **~ 1 John 5:20 NIV**

- This is the promise of Jesus for those who are pure in heart. That we would be able to understand and know the truth which is in Him.

> *"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”"* **~ John 8:12**

### How do we see God while we're still here on earth?
- We can see His Spirit moving in our lives through the lows and highs.

- We are able to discern and understand His word.

- The Holy Spirit ever guides us in every decision we make.

- These are just some of the ways we can see God. But we know that God reveals Himself to us in different and awesome ways.

## Reflection

- Are we walking in purity before the Lord?
- What's keeping us from being sensitive of God's revelation of Himself to us?

### Let us allow God to search our hearts and allow Him to purify us from all impurities.
