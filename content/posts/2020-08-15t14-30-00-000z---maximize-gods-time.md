To know how we can maximize God’s time, we must first know the value of Time.

Time is the most important resource we have. Time has value; a value that we should endeavor to use wisely. It does not mean that every waking minute must be spent immersed in activities, but we should have an awareness that time lost cannot be regained. We’ll never get back the time spent outside of God’s purposes of receiving and giving love. Our time here is too limited and too important to spend on burdens, stresses, sin, and worldly pursuits.

### For us Christians, we are to be good stewards of our time. If we’re going to make the most of this life, we must learn to center our time on the eternal value of meeting with God. 

## Time VS Money
Money lost can always be regained. We can find ways to regain the money lost but with time, we cannot regain Time.

We can never save Time. We can only *spend*, *waste* or *invest* time. Time management is equal to life management. If you manage your time wisely, you are living wisely.

### It is not about counting your days but making your days count.

Looking at the ways in which we spend our time is one of the best ways to assess the status of our heart. If we spend all our time working for and thinking about the things of the world, we can know that we have not yet come into a right revelation of God’s purposes for us. If we spend the majority of our time simply getting through our days trying to then maybe we have yet to surrender our lives fully to our Father.
Therefore we must always check our hearts.

To truly live and to live purposefully means that we will live fulfilling the purpose that God intended for us. To do so means we have to see ourselves the way He sees – living lives of purpose – and resolve to using our time to achieve that goal.

### Going back, how can we manage our God’s time? Emphasis on God’s time because this is to remind us that our time is not ours but it is God’s.

> *"15 So be careful how you live. Don’t live like fools, but like those who are wise. 16 Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. 17 Don’t act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do. 18 Don’t be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit, 19 singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts. 20 And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 21 And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ."* **~ Ephesians 5-15-21, NLT**

### Paul left us with the following points:

- **Reminder**: To be wise by making most of our time because the days are evil. 

- **Temptation**: Using God’s time for something else. Time spent not in God’s ways are time spent in evil ways.

- **Challenge**: God gave us this life/time, God wants us to spend it wisely.

- **How**: We need to understand what God wants us to do in this life. Let’s allow the Holy Spirit move in us and guide us so we can fulfil God’s will.

- **Prayer**: *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."* **~ Psalm 90:12**

Why teach? Because all of us are not good in managing our lives. It is so easy for us to waste time. It is easier for us to waste time than to use is wisely. Be careful at how the world distract us.

## Practical ways to maximize God’s time: TIMES

## Take Full Responsibility

> *"For we are each responsible for our own conduct."* **~ Galatians 6:5, NLT**

We make our own schedule. We decide on how we use our time. We can never make excuses because we have the same amount of time. Kahit anong status natin sa buhay, mayaman, mahirap, politician, student or what, each of us has 24 hours a day, 168 hours per week, the only difference we have is how we spend our time.

The main problem in spending time is *procrastination*. Delaying and postponing what needs to be done which can give us unnecessary stress. 

![procrastinate](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gE2SmFWRmpwCE2Q/giphy.gif)

Make a list and make it a habit to get things done as soon as possible. Let us not let the worldly things distract us. Lazy person is full of excuses. Stop complaining and start moving.

> *"The lazy person claims, “There’s a lion out there! If I go outside, I might be killed!”"* **~ Proverbs 22:13, NLT**

## Insist on God's Help

> *"18 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called—his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. 19 I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God’s power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power"* **~ Ephesians 5:18-19, NLT**

![help](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ymrVUKkqOI4am6wxU/giphy.gif)

We cannot do things on our own. We are weak to temptations therefore we must always ask for the Lord’s help. We have to insist God’s help in setting up goals. Every goal we set is faith goal because we still don’t know what will happen in the future. You trust in the lord. Ask God for help and he will provide.

Let us also ask for the Holy Spirit to lead us. If we are not led by the Holy Spirit, we will always feel exhausted and wasted. The Holy Spirit will never allow us to be at the extent of exhaustion. Holy Spirit will teach us how to use our time wisely. There is nothing we cannot master with the help of Christ who strengthen us.

## Most Important Issues First

> *"Don’t act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do."* **~ Ephesians 5:17, NLT**

Our priority is to understand God's will. Then working our time to fulfill that purpose. Focus on one goal at a time and understand the non-negotiables.

> ### “Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.” ~ Luke 2:52 NLT

#### In wisdom...
- Intellectual – Give yourself time to learn and never stop learning.

> *"Whoever gets sense loves his own soul; he who keeps understanding will discover good."* **~ Proverbs 19:8**

> *"Cease to hear instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge."* **~ Proverbs 19:27**

#### and stature...
- Physical – Take care of your health and body.

> *"19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 20 for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body."* **~ 1 Corinthians 6:19-20**

#### in favor with God...
- Spiritual – Grow intimate with God

> *"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen."* **~ 2 Peter 3:18**

> *"15 Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."* **~ Ephesians 5:15-17**

#### and man...
- Social - God wants us to be involved with people.

> *"And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment"* **~ Philippians 1:9, ESV**

> *"Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality."* **~ Romans 12:13 ESV**

![balance](https://media.giphy.com/media/myDXHnYYPxT4od4NEN/giphy.gif)

If you are managing your time wisely, there must be a balance between these four.  How‘s your intellectual growth? Your physical fitness? Your spiritual enrichment? Your social life? Are they in balance?

## Embark Now

It is your choice to say no, it is also your choice to say go but don’t ever wait for a perfect condition before you go. 

> *“If you wait for perfect conditions, you’ll never get anything done.”* **~ Ecclesiastes 11:4, TLB**

![doit](https://media.giphy.com/media/J7jsbfcJ2O5eo/giphy.gif)

Take it by faith, as long as you are doing God’s work, God will provide. Stop waiting for the perfect condition before we go. You can never know you master it until you’ve done it. You will discover the improvements as you go. Prepare what we can and the rest, trust in the Lord.

## Spiritual partners are necessary

![partner](https://media.giphy.com/media/jnavkGxUJiW6E6l8Dh/giphy.gif)

All of us are meant to be in a community. Our new identity in Christ is to be in part of the body of Christ which is the church. We are not meant to be alone. 

We need each other to maintain the balance in managing our time. You can never do things alone. You can do more with a whole body. Two heads are better than one for they have better return for their labor.

> *"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil."* **~ Ecclesiastes 4:9, NLT**

## Reflection

- The great thing about the nature of time is that it is completely ours to do with what we will. We can, right now, decide to make the best use of our time according to the purposes of God as revealed to us through Scripture. 

- We can, right now, decide to stop wasting precious minutes on that which is fleeting and temporal and instead invest our days in the lasting, eternal, and fruitful purposes of our heavenly Father.

- Find peace, joy, and purpose in the ways in which you invest your time today.
