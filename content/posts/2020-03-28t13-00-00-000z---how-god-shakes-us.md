With the pandemic situation affecting everyone around the globe, the series tackled recently here in Every Nation SG is very relevant and fitting. I'd like to share some important points I have learned from it which may give us a good perspective that can help us get through our tough situations right now, little by little. You can find and watch the sermons [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/everynationsg/). 

## God is shaking us
>"At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.” The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain." **~ Hebrews 12:26-27**

It is God's promise that He will shake us. That seems very odd because promises should be something good, right? But here we see that the Lord promised that. On v27, the words **"ONCE MORE"** were highlighted to indicate that this shaking will happen repeatedly. Furthermore, the purpose of this shaking is so that things that cannot be shaken may remain. How powerful! We usually use the term *"shake"* to remove something but this gives the other perspective -- **what remains**.

#### Life of Joseph
- The whole series revolves around the story of Joseph starting from when he was favored by his father, Jacob, up until he was sold to slavery in Egypt and then he found favor admist the toughest challenges he faced.
- His life is a good example of how God shakes our lives *to remove something*, so that something that *cannot be shaken shall remain*.

## Favor of Man vs. Favor of God
> "Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors." **~ Genesis 37:3**

##### Favor of Man
- When we are favored, we gain **audacity**. We believe in something big. We take bold risks.
- But oftentimes, when we are favored we also gain **arrogance**.
- In Genesis 37:5-11, Joseph shares with his brothers his dream about ruling over them. While his dream would become true later on, at that moment, that was all but a dream. He most probably knew he was favored by their father and that he is hated by his brothers but he proceeded to proudly share this dream with his brothers and that angered them more. Perhaps, this is arrogance.
- Moving forward the story, we know that Joseph's brothers plotted against him and sold him as a slave.
- ##### God shook Joseph's life when his brothers took his robe, stained it, and then sold him as a slave. The robe symbolizes the favor of man which God wants to remove. From a Father's favored son, he became a slave.

##### Favor of God
- In Genesis 39:2 - The Lord was with Joseph and he became a successful man. The Lord replaced favor of man with His favor.
- In Genesis 39:3, it says that his master saw that the Lord was with him. There was no arrogance.

##### Bow and Arrow
##### "The more God stretches us, the farther we go."

## Fear of Man vs. Fear of God
> "she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house." **~ Genesis 39:12**
- God yet again, shook Joseph's life by allowing him to be tempted by Potiphar's wide so he would recognize the **fear of God**. He was brought to prison but he was put in charge of the prisoners. The Lord's favor was with him.
- Joseph resisted temptation by RUNNING OUT despite the risk of being wrongly judged.
- If **fear of man** won over **fear of God** in Joseph, he would have compromised. Fear of man leads us to compromising.

> "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight." **~ Proverbs 9:10**

### *"Grace is to God's favor. Reverence is to fear of God."*

## Impatience vs. Faith
- As God continues to shake Joseph's life, he came to a point that he was about to rely on the favor of man again instead of the favor of God (Genesis 40:14-23). The chief cupbearer whom he hoped to be his key to leave prison did not remember him.
- If this happened, Joseph might have attributed his success to the cupbearer. But God made the cupbearer forget.
- **Faith is trusting God's perfect timing.** Joseph was 17 yrs old when he got to Egypt. He became governor at 30. He got impatient at one point but he put his faith in God and that's his FUEL towards his destiny.
- We overcome impatience through faith.

## Flight towards breakthroughs
Pastor Joey used the airplane as an analogy to how God shakes us and the things mentioned above. Our faith journey is like riding a plane. 
- The turbulence is the shaking that will always happen. It may come and go, not once, but multiple times.
- To get over the turbulence, we need stability and fuel.
- To achieve stability, we need *GRACE (Favor of God)* and *REVERENCE (Fear of God)*.
- *Faith* is our fuel.
- Our destination is our breakthroughs.

### *"Shakings can break you or become your breakthrough"*

### Reflections
- Which one do we have a greater tendency to rely and trust on? The favor or man, or the favor of God?
- Do you find yourself compromising because of your fear of men?
- What have you been impatient about? What do you do about it?
- What is God teaching you in this season of shaking?


As I've mentioned, this is from Every Nation SG's previous Sunday sermon series. This isn't the end of the series and last two installments were great sermons too. Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l2PCrR4kg&t=2525s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JMDnDaIms).
