## Why this topic? 

- Every time we meet, we are always praying for provision. Indeed, the Lord has always been faithful to meet our needs and even beyond. Now, let's dwell some time to reflect on how we view the blessings God provides us with, particularly money.
- As young working professionals, this topic is quite relevant.
- It is a personal challenge for me. And one of the most effective ways to really absorb & learn something is to teach it.

## 1 Timothy 6:9-11
> *9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. 11 But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.*

## “All” evils vs “all kinds” of evil
![bibleversion](/assets/loveofmoney_bibleversions.png)

- Interestingly, older version of the Bible use *"all evils"* instead of *"all kinds of evil"* which we now see in the latest versions. “All evils” is the formal English equivalent of the original Greek *(pantōn tōn kakōn)*

- Perhaps, in these modern times, some evils are unrelated to love of money. There are scholarly articles and discussions about this but that is not the focus of this topic. Ultimately, whatever is deemed to be correct, the underlying message stands - *love of money is a sin.* 

## 1 Timothy 6:9-10

- We can see how v9 and v10 seem to have a parallel flow of thought into how something can cause a drastic effect. In v9, the Scripture says that the *desire to be rich* fall into many harmful and senseless desires. This single desire ought to produce *many more* desires in return. 

- As we continue to read on v10, it declares that love of money is the *root* of all kinds of evils. This love of money in turn produces *all kinds* of evil. The desire to be rich corresponds to love of money, and the many desires corresponds to all kinds of evil.

## Love of Money

- Money in itself has no value. It is just a piece of paper or metal. It gains value when it can be traded for something. This something is could be a desire. However, there is one thing money could not be traded for - God. 

> ### Therefore, we can define love of money as longing for the things money can buy *minus* God.

> #### Good desires don’t destroy. Only desires for anything minus God destroy. That is what the love of money represents. Therefore, this love is the root of all evils that men commit. Because all evils come from that root desire — the desire for anything minus God. - John Piper

## Can we be rich and be a Christian?

The wise way to deal with sin is to **avoid situations** where we can be tempted or be swayed to engaged in sin. Since the desire to be rich leads to ruin, should we ultimately avoid being rich? Is it wrong to be rich? The Bible deals a lot with riches, but let's focus on these two verses to answer that question.

> *"Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.  Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God."* **~ Proverbs 30:8-9 NIV**

> *"I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."* **~ Philippians 4:12 NIV**

### *Sabi sa Proverbs, yung sapat lang. Sabi naman sa Philippians, in need or in plenty, we should be content.*

## Dangers of Wealth

![danger](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwHeQFezg1wVZXG/giphy.gif)

- 1 Timothy 6:17 - Desiring to be rich
- Matthew 6:25-34 - Worrying about money
- Luke 12:16-21 - Trusting in wealth instead of God
- Matthew 6:24 - Loving money as god
- James 2:1-7, Isaiah 3:15, Amos 2:6-7 - Using money to oppress other people

## Since being wealthy is dangerous, is it a sin to be one?

There are many rich people in the Bible. Surely, God blessed them to bless others. Hence, no. It is not a sin to be rich. A man can be rich and be one of God’s people.

In Matthew 6:24, Jesus uses the term *love* to describe the choice: We either love God, or we love money. He attaches the idea of *serving* to this idea of *loving*. Hence, as a Christian, we should choose to seek His Kingdom first, serve God, not money. Enjoy Him, not money.

## Our Heart's Condition

### Love of money is a heart condition, it is difficult for us to detect it in ourselves.

This is the real question. It is not wrong to be rich, but we should ask ourselves about our heart's condition.

## What are you content with?
Contentment is not based on what we have or our situation in life. Just like Paul, we can be content whether we are in plenty or in lack.

> "But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world." **~ 1 Timothy 6:7**

## What do you desire?
Having simple things in life is *not* a guarantee that we desire God above all, in the same way that having great wealth *does not* guarantee contentment. 

> "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction." **~ 1 Timothy 6:9**

## What are you pursuing?
When we focus on Christ, we find true satisfaction and contentment because He provides all our needs. As a result, we pursue righteousness and are no longer consumed by the love of money.

> "But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness." **~ 1 Timothy 6:11**
