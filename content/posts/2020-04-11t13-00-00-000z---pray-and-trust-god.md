> "For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." **~ Matthew 18:20**

We have three points to ponder tonight:
- Fairness is for Monkeys
- The God of Maybe
- The Power of Ask

## I. Fairness is for Monkeys

### We have a tendency to search for fairness
Watch this interesting [monkey experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg) showing how the monkeys demand for fairness.

- Ask ourselves: *Are we like monkeys when we feel like life is unfair?*
- If you have committed your life to Christ, one of the greatest victories you can achieve is when you come to the point of understanding that **your circumstances in life aren’t a measure of God’s trustworthiness.**
- The unlikely circumstances we experience in life does not mean God's inadequate presence and blessing in our lives.
- In fact, Christians are the benefactors of the **most unfair** exchange in the history of mankind, when our sins were nailed to the innocent Christ to the cross.

## II. The God of Maybe

### Maybe the Lord will act
- It’s approximately 1010 BC and, as is often the case, the Israelites are at war with the Philistines. This is before the David and Goliath event. God’s people are outnumbered and things are looking bleak. King Saul – who has already been rejected by God –when his Godly son, Jonathan, leaves the encampment with his lieutenant-armor-bearer and approaches enemy lines.
- The Philistines have perfect tactical position, overlooking the ever-weakening Israelite position.

> "Let’s go to the military post of these uncircumcised people. Maybe the Lord will act on our behalf. The Lord can win a victory with a few men as well as with many.” His armorbearer answered him, “Do whatever you have in mind. Go ahead! I agree with you.” **~ 1 Samuel 14:4-7**

- Let us focus on what Jonathan said -- *Maybe the Lord will act on our behalf*
- He wasn't so sure about it but this shows his trust and faith in the Lord.

### Even if he does not
- Maybe this is the same kind of spirit we see active in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who turned to King Nebuchadnezzar at their moment of truth in Daniel 3.

> "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand. But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." **~ Daniel 3:17-18**

- Like Jonathan, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego aren't entirely sure if they will be saved from the blazing furnace. But they had the assurance and security even if God will not deliver them.

### Take bold steps
We are challenged to take bold steps knowing that:
- We don’t know the future
- But, we can trust God no matter what happens

## III. The Power of Ask

> "If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" **~ Luke 11:13**

Let's reflect on these things:
- Why is asking even necessary? 
- Why does an omniscient God need any information from anyone? 
- Doesn’t He know what we need before we even ask it? (Matthew 6:8)

### We need the Lord

When we declare our need for someone, we are declaring **our surrender to control**, admitting we are lacking – helpless – in some important way – and placing our trust and dependence on the other. There’s a vulnerability, risk, and therefore powerful trust in **“I need you.”**

## *Keep safe and keep praying* 🙏
