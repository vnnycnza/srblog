> #### *"36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.” 37 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, 38 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. 39 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, 40 but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."* ~ Acts 15:36-41

Tonight, we talk about the story on the disagreement between Paul and Barnabas as they plan to visit the towns where they preached the word of the Lord. Barnabas decided to take Mark with him. Meanwhile, Paul chose Silas. Let's take a closer look on our 4 main characters in this story.

## Paul
![outspoken](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ov9jPzFImO8YoYl6o/giphy.gif)

- He is a Roman citizen
> *So the tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”* **~ Acts 22:27**

- He was a persecutor of Christians
> *"While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 6Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep." And Saul approved of their killing him."* **~ Acts 7:59-60, 8:1**

- He was a Pharisee
> *"Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”"*  **~ Acts 23:6**

- Hebrews of Hebrews
> *"circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;"* **~ Philippians 3:5**

- Apostles to the Gentiles

- Author of 13 books in the Bible

## Barnabas

- Joseph A Levite From Cyprus
- Son Of Encouragement
> *"Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”)"* **~ Acts 4:36**

- Wealthy Generous Levite
> *"sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet."* **~ Acts 4:37**

- John Mark's Cousin
> *"My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)"* **~ Colossians 4:10**

- He Was A Good Man Full Of The Holy Spirit And Faith
> *"He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord."* **~ Acts 11:24**

## Silas

![helper](https://media.giphy.com/media/5tdqLtVqpLrFiwY9PU/giphy.gif)

- Roman Citizen (Acts 16:37)
> *"But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”* **~ Acts 16:37**

- Leader And Teacher In Jerusalem Church (Acts 15:22)
> *"Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers."* **~ Acts 15:22**

- Faithful Brother 
- Peter's helper and companion
> "With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it." **~ 1 Peter 5:12**

## Mark
![flee](https://media.giphy.com/media/Zxzr2pp6qU64g/giphy.gif)

- John, a Jew by birth; also bore a roman surname Mark
- Paul and Barnabas' helper
> *"When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from[a] Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark."* **~ Acts 12:25**

- Peter's companion and interpreter
> *"She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark."* **~ 1 Peter 5:13**

- Author of Gospel of Mark

- He has a tendency to be a coward

> *"From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem"* **~ Acts 13:13**

> - The reason why Paul thought it wasn't wise to take Mark is found in Acts 13:13 where Mark fled to return to Jerusalem instead of continuing work with Paul.

> *"A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,  he fled naked, leaving his garment behind."* **~ Mark 14:51-52**

> - This event occurred in the Garden of Gethsemane the night Jesus was betrayed and captured. When Jesus was seized by the Roman soldiers, the young man escaped capture and ran, leaving the garment behind. The identity of the man is unknown, but since the Gospel of Mark is the only gospel that mentions the incident, many Bible scholars speculate that the young man was John Mark himself, the author of the Gospel of Mark.

### What can we learn from these 4 characters in the story?

Paul is a very bold and outspoken person. Meanwhile, Barnabas is depicted as an encourager, which is both his strength and also his weakness. In Galatians 2:11-16, he was led astray by hypocrisy. 

>  *"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”"* **~ Galatians 2:11-16**


Mark is not as faithful as how Silas is depicted to be one. Mark fled a mission and he has a tendency to be a coward. But, Paul still acknowledges him as we see in 2 Timothy 4:11.

> *"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry."* **~ 2 Timothy 4:11**

#### In our story, Barnabas seemed to see the need and potential of Mark. Meanwhile, Paul seemed to focus on the demands and potential of the larger cause of the Gospel.

#### Disagreements aren't avoidable especially in ministry. This disagreement might have been the mark of separation for Paul and Barnabas. But it didn't cease the ministry of the Lord. On the flip side, their ministries continued to strengthen the churches. 

### Side note: Is this a contradiction?

#### Mark 1:1-3 NIV

> The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:

> “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way” — “a voice of one calling in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’

#### Malachi 3:1 NIV

> “I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the Lord Almighty.

#### Isaiah 40:3 NIV

> "A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."
